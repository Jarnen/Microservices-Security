1. Incident commander name: 
    Jarnen Richard

2. Executive Summary of what happened:
    Falco runtime monitoring detected security breach this morning at 8:30 AM and was reported on Falco Dashboard via Grafana. 
    Crypto miners pods were executed in the cluster resulting in CPU and memory usage spikes.

3. Summary of what was affected:
    Three different pods executed and crypto miners were launched in the default namespace. The Kubernetes API server had been compromised and 
    accessed by an unauthorised personal to introduce and execute the pods.

4. Summmry of the impact:
    This has caused a spike in CPU and memory utilisation. Also Falco detected crypto miners using the stratum protocol based on Crypto rules.

5. Summary of the remediation steps:
    The pods are now had been evicted. In the long term, we need to secure the cluster by reviewing the access to the Kubernetes API server 
    from the administrative terminals.

6. Summary of lessons learned:
    Administrative terminals and authentication credentials should be accessible by authorised personal only. Admission controllers can also be
    configured to disallow unknown images to be used to create containers.
