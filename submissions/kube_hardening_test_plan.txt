Kubernetes-specific Test Plan 
The most important aspect of hardening is making sure the hardening does not negatively affect system stability. 
The last thing we want is for our hardening to lead to an outage of the cluster. Hence, we should have a test plan in place to implement
hardening steps. Two things we should consider are how we will test and how to ensure the changes does not negatively affect our cluster.

Our cluster should have a production and development (or test environment) environment. These two environments should be of replica to each other.
Before applying a hardening change to the production environment, it should be applied to the development environment. After all tests are confirmed
to be successful in the development environment, then it can be applied to the production environment.

There should be a checklist to check the cluster components and services that would be affected. These checks should be done before and
after the change is done to confirm if the change does not cause any unforeseen service outage. A reverse plan should be inplace to revert the
changes if environment is negatively affected. Finally, and also important, the cluster should have backups in case a restore is needed in worst
case scenario.
