Kubernetes-specific Test Plan 
The most important aspect of hardening is making sure the hardening does not negatively affect system stability. 
The last thing we want is for our hardening to lead to an outage of the cluster. Hence, we should have a test plan in place to implement
hardening steps. Two things we should consider are how we will test and how to ensure the changes does not negatively affect our cluster.

Our cluster should have a production and development (or test environment) environment. These two environments should be of replica to each other.
Before applying a hardening change to the production environment, it should be applied to the development environment. After tests confirmed
ok in the development environment, then it can be applied to the production environment. 

There should be a checklist to check the cluster components and services that would be affected. This checks should be done before and 
after the change is done to confirm if the change does not cause any unforseen service outage. A reverse plan should be inpalce to revert the 
changes if environment is negatively affected. Finaly and also important, the cluster should have backups incase a restore is needed in a worst
case scenario.
